# R Basics

## What is R?

- R is a programming language, a high-level "interpreted language"
- R is an interactive environment
- R is used for doing statistics and data science

## Pros and Cons of R

- R is free and open-source
- R stays on the cutting-edge because of its ability to utilize independently developed "packages"
- R has some [peculiar featues](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/r_language_for_programmers/) that experienced programmers should note (see [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf))
- R has an [amazing](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats) [community](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/r/info) of passionate users and developers

## RStudio

- RStudio is an IDE (integrated development environment) for R

- It contains many useful features for using R

- We will use the free version of RStudio in this course


## Getting Started in R

### Calculator

Operations on numbers: `+ - * / ^`

```{r}
2+1
```

```{r}
6+3*4-2^3
```

```{r}
6+(3*4)-(2^3)
```

### Atomic Classes

There are five atomic classes (or modes) of objects in R:

1. character
2. complex
3. integer
4. logical
5. numeric (real number)

There is a sixth called "raw" that we will not discuss.

### Assigning Values to Variables

```{r}
x <- "qcb508" # character
x <- 2+1i     # complex
x <- 4L       # integer
x <- TRUE     # logical
x <- 3.14159  # numeric
```

Note: Anything typed after the `#` sign is not evaluated.  The `#` sign allows you to add comments to your code.

### More Ways to Assign Values

```{r}
x <- 1
1 -> x
x = 1
```

In this class, we ask that you only use `x <- 1`.

### Evaluation

When a complete expression is entered at the prompt, it is evaluated and the result of the evaluated expression is returned. The result may be auto-printed.

```{r}
x <- 1
x+2
print(x)
print(x+2)
```

### Functions

There are [many useful functions](http://www.statmethods.net/management/functions.html) included in R.  "Packages" (covered later) can be loaded as libraries to provide additional functions.  You can also write your own functions in any R session.

Here are some examples of built-in functions:

```{r}
x <- 2
print(x)
sqrt(x)
log(x)
class(x)
is.vector(x)
```

### Accessing Help in R

You can open the help file for any function by typing `?` with the functions name.  Here is an example:

```{r}
?sqrt
```

There's also a function `help.search` that can do general searches for help.  You can learn about it by typing:

```{r}
?help.search
```

It's also useful to use Google: for example, ["r help square root"](https://www.google.com/search?q=r+help+square+root).  The R help files are also on the web.

### Variable Names

In the previous examples, we used `x` as our variable name.  Do not use the following variable names, as they have special meanings in R:

```
c, q, s, t, C, D, F, I, T
```

When combining two words for a given variable, we recommend one of these options:

```{r}
my_variable <- 1
myVariable <- 1
```

Variable names such as `my.variable` are problematic because of the special use of "." in R.

### Vectors

The vector is the most basic object in R. You can create vectors in a number of ways.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
x

y <- 1:40
y

z <- seq(from=0, to=100, by=10)
z
length(z)
```

### Vectors

- Programmers: vectors are indexed starting at `1`, not `0`
- A vector can only contain elements of a single class:

```{r}
x <- "a"
x[0]
x[1]

y <- 1:3
z <- c(x, y, TRUE, FALSE)
z
```


### Matrices

Like vectors, matrices are objects that can contain elements of only one class.

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3)
m

m <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
m
```

### Factors

In statistics, factors encode categorical data. 

```{r}
paint <- factor(c("red", "white", "blue", "blue", "red", 
                  "red"))
paint

table(paint)
unclass(paint)
```

### Lists

Lists allow you to hold different classes of objects in one variable.

```{r}
x <- list(1:3, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE))
x

## access any element of the list
x[[2]]
x[[3]][2]
```

### Lists with Names

The elements of a list can be given names.

```{r}
x <- list(counting=1:3, char="a", logic=c(TRUE, FALSE))
x

## access any element of the list
x$char
x$logic[2]
```


### Missing Values

In data analysis and model fitting, we often have missing values.  `NA` represents missing values and `NaN` means "not a number", which is a special type of missing value.

```{r}
m <- matrix(nrow=3, ncol=3)
m
0/1
1/0
0/0
```

### `NULL`

`NULL` is a special type of reserved value in R.

```{r}
x <- vector(mode="list", length=3)
x
```

### Coercion

We saw earlier that when we mixed classes in a vector they were all coerced to be of type character:

```{r}
c("a", 1:3, TRUE, FALSE)
```

You can directly apply coercion with functions `as.numeric()`, `as.character()`, `as.logical()`, etc.

This doesn't always work out well:
```{r}
x <- 1:3
as.character(x)

y <- c("a", "b", "c")
as.numeric(y)
```

### Data Frames

The data frame is one of the most important objects in R.  Data sets very often come in tabular form of mixed classes, and data frames are constructed exactly for this.

Data frames are lists where each element has the same length.


### Data Frames

```{r}
df <- data.frame(counting=1:3, char=c("a", "b", "c"), 
                 logic=c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
df

nrow(df)
ncol(df)
```

### Data Frames

```{r}
dim(df)

names(df)

attributes(df)
```

### Attributes

Attributes give information (or meta-data) about R objects.  The previous slide shows `attributes(df)`, the attributes of the data frame `df`.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
attributes(x) # no attributes for a standard vector

m <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3)
attributes(m)

```


```{r}
paint <- factor(c("red", "white", "blue", "blue", "red", 
                  "red"))
attributes(paint)
```


### Names
Names can be assigned to columns and rows of vectors, matrices, and data frames. This makes your code easier to write and read.

```{r}
names(x) <- c("Princeton", "Rutgers", "Penn")
x

colnames(m) <- c("NJ", "NY", "PA")
rownames(m) <- c("East", "West")
m
colnames(m)
```

### Accessing Names

Displaying or assigning names to these three types of objects does not have consistent syntax.

Object | Column Names | Row Names
-------|--------------|----------
vector | `names()` | N/A
data frame | `names()` | `row.names()`
data frame | `colnames()` | `rownames()`
matrix | `colnames()` | `rownames()`

# Reproducible Data Analysis

## Definition and Motivation

- Reproducibility involves *being able to recalculate the exact numbers in a data analysis using the code and raw data provided by the analyst*. 

- Reproducibility is often difficult to achieve and has slowed down the discovery of important data analytic errors. 

- Reproducibility should not be confused with "correctness" of a data analysis. A data analysis can be fully reproducible and recreate all numbers in an analysis and still be misleading or incorrect.

From [*Elements of Data Analytic Style*](https://leanpub.com/datastyle), by Leek

## Reproducible vs. Replicable

*Reproducible research* is often used these days to indicate the ability to recalculate the exact numbers in a data analysis

*Replicable research results* often refers to the ability to independently carry out a study (thereby collecting new data) and coming to equivalent conclusions as the original study

These two terms are often confused, so it is important to clearly state the definition

## Steps to a Reproducible Analysis

1. Use a data analysis script -- e.g., R Markdown (discussed next section!) or iPython Notebooks

2. Record versions of software and paramaters -- e.g., use `sessionInfo()` in R as in  `hw_1.Rmd`

3. Organize your data analysis

4. Use version control -- e.g., GitHub

5. Set a random number generator seed -- e.g., use `set.seed()` in R

6. Have someone else run your analysis

## Organizing Your Data Analysis

- Data
    - raw data
    - processed data (sometimes multiple stages for very large data sets)
- Figures
    - Exploratory figures
    - Final figures


- R code
    - Raw or unused scripts
    - Data processing scripts
    - Analysis scripts
- Text
    - README files explaining what all the components are
    - Final data analysis products like presentations/writeups

## Common Mistakes

- Failing to use a script for your analysis
- Not recording software and package version numbers or other settings used
- Not sharing your data and code
- Using reproducibility as a social weapon

## R Markdown

### R + Markdown + knitr

R Markdown was developed by the RStudio team to allow one to write reproducible research documents using Markdown and `knitr`.  This is contained in the `rmarkdown` package, but can easily be carried out in RStudio. 

Markdown was originally developed as a very simply text-to-html conversion tool.  With Pandoc, Markdown is a very simply text-to-`X` conversion tool where `X` can be many different formats: html, LaTeX, PDF, Word, etc.

### R Markdown Files

R Markdown documents begin with a metadata section, the YAML header, that can include information on the title, author, and date as well as options for customizing output.
```
title: "QCB 508 -- Homework 1"
author: "Your Name"
date: February 23, 2017
output: pdf_document
```

Many options are available.  See <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> for full documentation.

### Markdown

Headers:
```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

Emphasis:
```
*italic* **bold**
_italic_ __bold__
```

Tables:
```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
```


Unordered list:
```
- Item 1
- Item 2
    - Item 2a
    - Item 2b
```

Ordered list:
```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    - Item 3a
    - Item 3b
```


Links:
```
http://example.com

[linked phrase](http://example.com)
```

Blockquotes:
```
Florence Nightingale once said:

> For the sick it is important 
> to have the best. 
```


Plain code blocks:  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(c("```",
      "This text is displayed verbatim with no formatting.",
      "```"), 
    sep='\n')
```

Inline Code:
```
We use the `print()` function to print the contents 
of a variable in R.
```
  
Additional documentation and examples can be found [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) and [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).

### LaTeX

LaTeX is a markup language for technical writing, especially for mathematics.  It can be include in R Markdown files.

For example,

```
$y = a + bx + \epsilon$
```

produces

$y = a + bx + \epsilon$

[Here](https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX) is an introduction to LaTeX and [here](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/#math-in-r-markdown) is a primer on LaTeX for R Markdown.

### knitr

The `knitr` R package allows one to execute R code within a document, and to display the code itself and its output (if desired). This is particularly easy to do in the R Markdown setting.  For example...

*Placing the following text in an R Markdown file*

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("The sum of 2 and 2 is `r 2+2`.")
```

*produces in the output file*  

The sum of 2 and 2 is `r 2+2`.

### knitr Chunks

Chunks of R code separated from the text.  In R Markdown:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(c("```{r}",
      "x <- 2",
      "x + 1",
      "print(x)",
      "```"), 
    sep='\n')
```

Output in file:
```{r}
x <- 2
x + 1
print(x)
```

### Chunk Option: `echo`

In R Markdown:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(c("```{r, echo=FALSE}",
      "x <- 2",
      "x + 1",
      "print(x)",
      "```"), 
    sep='\n')
```

Output in file:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- 2
x + 1
print(x)
```

### Chunk Option: `results`

In R Markdown:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(c("```{r, results=\"hide\"}",
      "x <- 2",
      "x + 1",
      "print(x)",
      "```"), 
    sep='\n')
```

Output in file:
```{r, results="hide"}
x <- 2
x + 1
print(x)
```

### Chunk Option: `include`

In R Markdown:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(c("```{r, include=FALSE}",
      "x <- 2",
      "x + 1",
      "print(x)",
      "```"), 
    sep='\n')
```

Output in file:
```{r, include=FALSE}
x <- 2
x + 1
print(x)
```
(nothing)

### Chunk Option: `eval`

In R Markdown:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(c("```{r, eval=FALSE}",
      "x <- 2",
      "x + 1",
      "print(x)",
      "```"), 
    sep='\n')
```

Output in file:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 2
x + 1
print(x)
```

### Chunk Names

Naming your chunks can be useful for identifying them in your file and during the execution, and also to denote dependencies among chunks.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(c("```{r my_first_chunk}",
      "x <- 2",
      "x + 1",
      "print(x)",
      "```"), 
    sep='\n')
```

### knitr Option: `cache`

Sometimes you don't want to run chunks over and over, especially for large calculations.  You can "cache" them.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(c("```{r chunk1, cache=TRUE, include=FALSE}",
      "x <- 2",
      "```"), 
    sep='\n')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(c("```{r chunk2, cache=TRUE, dependson=\"chunk1\"}",
      "y <- 3",
      "z <- x + y",
      "```"), 
    sep='\n')
```

This creates a directory called `cache` in your working directory that stores the objects created or modified in these chunks. When `chunk1` is modified, it is re-run.  Since `chunk2` depends on `chunk1`, it will also be re-run.

### knitr Options: figures

You can add chunk options regarding the placement and size of figures.  Examples include:

- `fig.width`
- `fig.height`
- `fig.align`

### Changing Default Chunk Settings

If you will be using the same options on most chunks, you can set default options for the entire document.  Run something like this at the beginning of your document with your desired chunk options.
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(c("```{r my_opts, cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}",
      "library(\"knitr\")",
      "opts_chunk$set(fig.align=\"center\", fig.height=4, fig.width=6)",
      "```"), 
    sep='\n')
```

# R Programming

## Control Structures

### Rationale

- Control structures in R allow you to control the flow of execution of a series of R expressions

- They allow you to put some logic into your R code, rather than just always executing the same R code every time

- Control structures also allow you to respond to inputs or to features of the data and execute different R expressions accordingly

Paraphrased from [*R Programming for Data Science*](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming), by Peng

### Common Control Structures

- `if` and `else`: testing a condition and acting on it
- `for`: execute a loop a fixed number of times
- `while`: execute a loop while a condition is true
- `repeat`: execute an infinite loop (must break out of it to stop)
- `break`: break the execution of a loop
- `next`: skip an interation of a loop

From *R Programming for Data Science*, by Peng

### Some Boolean Logic

R has built-in functions that produce `TRUE` or `FALSE` such as `is.vector` or `is.na`.  You can also do the following:

- `x == y` : does x equal y?
- `x > y` : is x greater than y? (also `<` less than)
- `x >= y` : is x greater than or equal to y?
- `x && y` : are both x and y true?
- `x || y` : is either x or y true?
- `!is.vector(x)` : this is `TRUE` if x is not a vector

### `if`

Idea:
```
if(<condition>) {
        ## do something
} 
### Continue with rest of code
```

Example:
```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3)
if(is.numeric(x)) {
  x+2
}
```

### `if`-`else`

Idea:
```
if(<condition>) {
        ## do something
} 
else {
        ## do something else
}
```

Example:
```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c")
if(is.numeric(x)) {
  print(x+2)
} else {
  class(x)
}
```

### `for` Loops

Example:

```{r}
for(i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}
```


Examples:

```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")

for(i in 1:4) {
  print(x[i])
}

for(i in seq_along(x)) {
  print(x[i])
}
```


### Nested `for` Loops

Example:

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)

for(i in seq_len(nrow(m))) {
  for(j in seq_len(ncol(m))) {
    print(m[i,j])
  }
}
```

### `while`

Example:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
idx <- 1

while(x[idx] < 4) {
  print(x[idx])
  idx <- idx + 1
}

idx
```
Repeats the loop until while the condition is `TRUE`.

### `repeat`

Example:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
idx <- 1

repeat {
  print(x[idx])
  idx <- idx + 1
  if(idx >= 4) {
    break
  }
}

idx
```
Repeats the loop until `break` is executed.

### `break` and `next`

`break` ends the loop. `next` skips the rest of the current loop iteration.

Example:

```{r}
x <- 1:1000
for(idx in 1:1000) {
  # %% calculates division remainder
  if((x[idx] %% 2) > 0) { 
    next
  } else if(x[idx] > 10) { # an else-if!!
    break
  } else {
    print(x[idx])
  }
}
```


## Vectorized Operations

### Calculations on Vectors

R is usually smart about doing calculations with vectors.  Examples:

```{r}

x <- 1:3
y <- 4:6

2*x     # same as c(2*x[1], 2*x[2], 2*x[3])
x + 1   # same as c(x[1]+1, x[2]+1, x[3]+1)
x + y   # same as c(x[1]+y[1], x[2]+y[2], x[3]+y[3])
x*y     # same as c(x[1]*y[1], x[2]*y[2], x[3]*y[3])
```

### A Caveat

If two vectors are of different lengths, R tries to find a solution for you (and doesn't always tell you).

```{r}
x <- 1:5
y <- 1:2
x+y
```

What happened here?

### Vectorized Matrix Operations

Operations on matrices are also vectorized.  Example:

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:4, nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
y <- matrix(1:4, nrow=2, ncol=2)

x+y

x*y
```

### Mixing Vectors and Matrices

What happens when we do calculations involving a vector and a matrix? Example:

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
z <- 1:2

x + z

x * z
```

### Mixing Vectors and Matrices

Another example:

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
z <- 1:3

x + z

x * z
```

What happened this time?

### Vectorized Boolean Logic

We saw `&&` and `||` applied to pairs of logical values.  We can also vectorize these operations.

```{r}
a <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
b <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

a | b
a & b
```

## Subsetting R Objects

### Subsetting Vectors

```{r}
x <- 1:8

x[1]           # extract the first element
x[2]           # extract the second element

x[1:4]         # extract the first 4 elements

x[c(1, 3, 4)]  # extract elements 1, 3, and 4
x[-c(1, 3, 4)] # extract all elements EXCEPT 1, 3, and 4
```

### Subsetting Vectors

```{r}
names(x) <- letters[1:8]
x

x[c("a", "b", "f")]

s <- x > 3
s
x[s]
```

### Subsettng Matrices

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
x

x[1,2]
x[1, ]
x[ ,2]
```

### Subsettng Matrices

```{r}
colnames(x) <- c("A", "B", "C")

x[ , c("B", "C")]

x[c(FALSE, TRUE), c("B", "C")]

x[2, c("B", "C")]
```

### Subsettng Matrices

```{r}
s <- (x %% 2) == 0
s

x[s]

x[c(2, 3, 6)]
```


### Subsetting Lists

```{r}
x <- list(my=1:3, favorite=c("a", "b", "c"), 
          course=c(FALSE, TRUE, NA))

x[[1]]
x[["my"]]
x$my
```

```{r}
x[[c(3,1)]]
x[[3]][1]
```

```{r}
x[c(3,1)]
```

### Subsetting Data Frames

```{r}
x <- data.frame(my=1:3, favorite=c("a", "b", "c"), 
          course=c(FALSE, TRUE, NA))

x[[1]]
x[["my"]]
x$my
```

```{r}
x[[c(3,1)]]
x[[3]][1]
```

```{r}
x[c(3,1)]
```

### Subsetting Data Frames

```{r}
x <- data.frame(my=1:3, favorite=c("a", "b", "c"), 
          course=c(FALSE, TRUE, NA))

x[1, ]
x[ ,3]
x[ ,"favorite"]
```

```{r}
x[1:2, ]
x[ ,2:3]
```

### Note on Data Frames

R often converts character strings to factors unless you specify otherwise.  

In the previous slide, we saw it converted the "favorite" column to factors. Let's fix that...

```{r}
x <- data.frame(my=1:3, favorite=c("a", "b", "c"), 
                course=c(FALSE, TRUE, NA), 
                stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

x[ ,"favorite"]
class(x[ ,"favorite"])
```


### Missing Values

```{r}
data("airquality", package="datasets")
head(airquality)
dim(airquality)
```

```{r}
which(is.na(airquality$Ozone))
sum(is.na(airquality$Ozone))
```

### Subsetting by Matching

```{r}
letters
vowels <- c("a", "e", "i", "o", "u")

letters %in% vowels
which(letters %in% vowels)

letters[which(letters %in% vowels)]
```

### Advanced Subsetting 

The [*R Programming for Data Science*](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming) chapter titled "Subsetting R Objects" contains additional material on subsetting that you should know.


The [*Advanced R*](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html) website contains more detailed information on subsetting that you may find useful.


## Functions 

### Rationale 

- Writing functions is a core activity of an R programmer. It represents the key step of the transition from a mere user to a developer who creates new functionality for R. 

- Functions are often used to encapsulate a sequence of expressions that need to be executed numerous times, perhaps under slightly different conditions. 

- Functions are also often written when code must be shared with others or the public.

From *R Programming for Data Science*, by Peng

### Defining a New Function

- Functions are defined using the `function()` directive

- They are stored as variables, so they can be passed to other functions and assigned to new variables

- Arguments and a final return object are defined

### Example 1

```{r}
my_square <- function(x) {
  x*x  # can also do return(x*x)
}

my_square(x=2)

my_fun2 <- my_square
my_fun2(x=3)
```

### Example 2

```{r}
my_square_ext <- function(x) {
  y <- x*x
  return(list(x_original=x, x_squared=y))
}

my_square_ext(x=2)

z <- my_square_ext(x=2)
```

### Example 3

```{r}
my_power <- function(x, e, say_hello) {
  if(say_hello) {
    cat("Hello World!")
  }
  x^e
}

my_power(x=2, e=3, say_hello=TRUE)

z <- my_power(x=2, e=3, say_hello=TRUE)
z
```


### Default Function Argument Values

Some functions have default values for their arguments:
```{r}
str(matrix)
```

You can define a function with default values by the following:
```
f <- function(x, y=2) {
  x + y
}
```
If the user types `f(x=1)` then it defaults to `y=2`, but if the user types `f(x=1, y=3)`, then it executes with these assignments.

### The Ellipsis Argument

You will encounter functions that include as a possible argument the ellipsis: `...`

This basically holds arguments that can be passed to functions called within a function.  Example:

```{r}
double_log <- function(x, ...) {
  log((2*x), ...)
}

double_log(x=1, base=2)
double_log(x=1, base=10)
```

### Argument Matching

R tries to automatically deal with function calls when the arguments are not defined explicity. For example:

```
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)  # versus
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3, TRUE)
```

I strongly recommend that you define arguments explcitly. For example, I can never remember which comes first in `matrix()`, `nrow` or `ncol`.

## Environment

### Loading `.RData` Files

An `.RData` file is a binary file containing R objects.  These can be saved from your current R session and also loaded into your current session.

```{r, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
load("./data/project_1_R_basics.RData")
```

```
> # generally...
> # to load:
> load(file="path/to/file_name.RData")
> # to save:
> save(file="path/to/file_name.RData")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## assumes file in working directory
load(file="project_1_R_basics.RData") 
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## loads from our GitHub repository
load(file=url("https://github.com/SML201/project1/raw/
         master/project_1_R_basics.RData")) 
```

### Listing Objects

The objects in your current R session can be listed. An environment can also be specificied in case you have objects stored in different environments.

```{r}
ls()

ls(name=globalenv())

## see help file for other options
?ls
```


### Removing Objects

You can remove specific objects or all objects from your R environment of choice.

```{r}
rm("some_ORFE_profs") # removes variable some_ORFE_profs

rm(list=ls()) # Removes all variables from environment
```

### Advanced

The R environment is there to connect object names to object values.  

The [*R Programming for Data Science*](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming) chapter titled "Scoping Rules of R" discussed environments and object names in more detail than we need for this course.  

A useful discussion about environments can also be found on the [*Advanced R*](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Environments.html) web site.

## Packages

### Rationale

"In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package. A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others. As of January 2015, there were over 6,000 packages available on the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork, or [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html), the public clearing house for R packages. This huge variety of packages is one of the reasons that R is so successful: the chances are that someone has already solved a problem that you’re working on, and you can benefit from their work by downloading their package."

From <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html> by Hadley Wickham

### Contents of a Package

- R functions
- R data objects
- Help documents for using the package
- Information on the authors, dependencies, etc.
- Information to make sure it "plays well" with R and other packages

### Installing Packages

From CRAN:
```
install.packages("dplyr")
```

From GitHub (for advanced users):
```
library("devtools")
install_github("hadley/dplyr")
```

From Bioconductor (basically CRAN for biology):
```
library("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("qvalue")
```

Be *very* careful about dependencies when installing from GitHub.


Multiple packages:
```
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2"))
```

Install all dependencies:
```
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2"), dependencies=TRUE)
```

Updating packages:
```
update.packages()
```

### Loading Packages

Two ways to load a package:

```
library("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

I prefer the former.

### Getting Started with a Package

When you install a new package and load it, what's next?  I like to look at the help files and see what functions and data sets a package has.

```
library("dplyr")
help(package="dplyr")
```

### Specifying a Function within a Package

You can call a function from a specific package.  Suppose you are in a setting where you have two packages loaded that have functions with the same name.

```
dplyr::arrange(mtcars, cyl, disp)
```

This calls the `arrange` functin specifically from `dplyr`.  The package `plyr` also has an `arrange` function.

### More on Packages

We will be covering several highly used R packages in depth this semester, so we will continue to learn about packages, how they are organized, and how they are used.

You can download the "source" of a package from R and take a look at the contents if you want to dig deeper.  There are also many good tutorials on creating packages, such as <http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/>.



## Organizing Your Code

### Suggestions

RStudio conveniently tries to automatically format your R code.  We suggest the following in general.

1\. No more than 80 characters per line (or fewer depending on how R Markdown compiles): 
```
really_long_line <- my_function(x=20, y=30, z=TRUE,
                                a="Joe", b=3.8)
```

2\. Indent 2 or more characters for nested commands:
```
for(i in 1:10) {
  if(i > 4) {
    print(i)
  }
}
```


3\. Generously comment your code.

```
## a for-loop that prints the index 
## whenever it is greater than 4
for(i in 1:10) {
  if(i > 4) {
    print(i)
  }
}
## a good way to get partial credit
## if something goes wrong :-)
```

4\. Do not hesitate to write functions to organize tasks.  These help to break up your code into more undertsandable pieces, and functions can often be used several times.

### Where to Put Files

See the [*Elements of Data Analytic Style*](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming) chapter titled "Reproducibility" for suggestions on how to organize your files.

In this course, we will keep this relatively simple.  We will try to provide you with some organization when distributing the projects.
